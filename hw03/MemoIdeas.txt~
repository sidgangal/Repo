1. Face detecting and following robot:
The robot will detect a human face through the help of a mini-camera connected with bea-
gleboard and then beagleboard will drive the actuators(here wheels of the robot) to follow
the person. The bot can be made to follow specific person/people if camera quality and face
detection is good.

2. Smart Home Door Opening System
A Webcam mounted atop a door will take a photo when a person comes in its proximity and send a photo 
to a phone. The owner can now choose to open the door.

3. Monitoring natural processes around the campus:
This can include monitoring daily solar insolation, wind speed, weather(temperature, rain-
fall etc.). The data will be collected by beaglboard through various sensors.
