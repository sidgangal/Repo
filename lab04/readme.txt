Used buttons to control LED Matrix.
Used it independently as well.

The Wiring is done as given in the diagram.
The bicolor 8X8 LED Matrix is manipulated by means of hex addressing modes.Giving a particular hex code activates a particular led block. 
Hex when written in binary occupies 4 bits. 
Therefore 2 hex digits give 8 bits, which represent the 8 blocks in a row. 
The blocks to light are given binary 1 while others are given 0 to indicate what led's are to be lighted.
In the same way we controlled individual led's with the above mentioned devices, we are going to activate the required leds to get the desired display.
