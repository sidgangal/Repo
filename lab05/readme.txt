There is always some error in the measurement of the distance. We can see that the error increases with increase in distance, but the percentage of error decreases.

The ultrasonic sensor has two cylinder like objects attached to them. One sends the ultrasonic wave while the other recieves the reflected wave. 
When Input is given to the trigger pin, a wave is sent and when the wave is recieved back, the echo pin is given logic 1 and input is given to the Beaglebone.
We now know time. We already know the wave velocity.

Hence distance d
d= v*t
